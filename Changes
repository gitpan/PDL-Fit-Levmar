 - Removed non-fatal warnings from liblevmar 'starting point not feasible'
 - Removed all uses of int's as pointers, as this is not portable to,
   for instance, AMD64. Also did explicit casts to remove 'int to pointer without
   cast' type warnings. (I don't see whats happening here, but its casting perl IVs,
   which are supposed to be able to hold pointers.

 - Fixed bug that prevented x and t from having different dimensions.
   This allows multi-dimensional data where t represents the same data
   for each of the co-ordinates axes. Added an example to the docs and
   the test directory using this feature.
