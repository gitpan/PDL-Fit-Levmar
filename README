This module contains a PDL (Perl Data Language) interface to
the levmar library. The levmar library contains
Levenberg-Marquardt fitting routines (by Manolis
Lourakis). Levmar provides a single entry point to twelve
routines in the library (plus some utility routines). These
routines offer: fitting with numerical or analytic
jacobians; single or double precision; no constraints, or
linear constraints, or box constraints.

This module will build under PDL 2.4.2 as well as the current
cvs version of PDL.

See INSTALL for instructions on building and installing and
dependencies on external libraries. In brief, you need only
a standard PDL installation and lapack and blas shared
libraries and headers.

See ./scantree.pl in this directory for installing online pdl docs.
It is modified a bit from the one supplied in PDL 2.4.2.

 Put 'levmar' in the subject line or I will almost certainly never get it.
