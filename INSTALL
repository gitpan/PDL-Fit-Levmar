PDL::Fit::Levmar installation notes.

You **must** have the perl module **PDL** **installed**
 **before** building this module. The linux package is often
called 'pdl'.

If you manage to port this module to Win32, I'd like to hear
about it, but I don't know how to do it.

For the most part, under a fairly standard linux installation,
and  only if you have the dependencies (see below) installed...

Build:
perl Makefile.PL && make

Test:
'make test 2> err.out' or, if that fails, ' make test '.

You can see a bit more detail if you do
 ./levtest

Install:
To install, as root, do
make install

------------------------------------
Dependencies:

The following shared libraries or equivalents are required (version numbers are
those used for testing this module.)
liblapack.so.3
libblas.so.3
libg2c.so.0

Linking against these shared libaries requires, for instance under debian, that
the following development packages be installed.

libg2c0-dev GNU Fortran 77 library development
lapack3-dev library of linear algebra routines 3 - static library
refblas3-dev   Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines 3, static library

These libraries are used in building upstream levmar library. There
are other options for providing the lapack and blas routines. If you
use these other libraries, you have to edit Makefile.PL
