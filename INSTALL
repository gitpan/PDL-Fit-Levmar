PDL::Fit::Levmar installation notes.

You **must** have the perl module **PDL** **installed**
 **before** building this module. The linux package is often
called 'pdl'.

This module has been installed on *nix, Mac OSX, and Win32
platforms.

You may need to edit the lines specifying $hash{LIBS} in Makefile.PL
to give the proper flags to the linker regarding your lapack
and blas libraries.

For Win32, the default Makefile.PL assumes that liblapack.a and
librefblas.a are in the parent directory of the distribution. The
libraries used in testing were built with gfortran under mingw.

For the most part, under a fairly standard linux installation,
and  only if you have the dependencies (see below) installed...

Build:
perl Makefile.PL && make

Test:
'make test 2> err.out' or, if that fails, ' make test '.

You can see a bit more detail if you do
 ./levtest

Install:
To install, as root, do
make install

------------------------------------
Dependencies:

The following shared libraries or equivalents are required (version numbers are
those used for testing this module.)
liblapack.so.3
libblas.so.3
libg2c.so.0

Linking against these shared libaries requires, for instance under debian, that
the following development packages be installed.

libg2c0-dev GNU Fortran 77 library development
lapack3-dev library of linear algebra routines 3 - static library
refblas3-dev   Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines 3, static library

These libraries are used in building upstream levmar library.
